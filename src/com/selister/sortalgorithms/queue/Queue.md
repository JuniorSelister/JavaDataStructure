# Abstract data type

## FIFO - First In, First Out

> Queue method

```
add - also called enqueue - add an item to the end of the queue
remove - also called dequeue - remove the item at the front of the queue
peek - get the item at the front of the queue, but don't remove it
```

## Complexity time for Queue operations

> add - O(nlogn)

> remove - O(log(n))

> peek - O(1)
